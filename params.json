{"name":"Elmax C++ File Library","tagline":"Elmax C++ File Library","body":"### Elmax C++ File Library\r\nThis library is one developer's effort to produce a modern cross-platform C++ file library to write/read structured data in text or binary format intuitively and safely. Think of it as a type-safe alternative of fprintf/fscanf. Elmax file library is originally written for use in Portable Elmax XML library (still in development). For text files, ASCII, big-endian/small-endian Unicode and UTF-8 are supported while for binary files, built-in types and strings are supported. It has been tested to work on Windows, Linux and OSX. This library comes in 2 favours: C++98/03 and C++11: C++11 library make use of variadic templates to remove the maximum number of arguments limitation. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nWong Shao Voon is the sole author of Elmax C++ File Library.
